This fold includes the samples used to train and test SafeExit, as well as the 
variables of input scenario for each program.

In the file of input-scenario variable, there probably are four sections:
workload variable, config variable, workload constrain and config constrain.

In each sample file (both testing and training), the first line contains the 
input-scenario variables, while each other line is a sample of these variables.
